## 🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM APPLICATION

All pages now strictly adhere to the **Aurum Vault Military-Grade Design System**:

- **Colors:** Usage of `gold-500` for branding, `emerald`/`ruby` for financial status.
- **Typography:** `Playfair Display` for headers, `Inter` for UI, `JetBrains Mono` for IDs/Amounts.
- **Interactions:** Hover effects on rows, smooth transitions on modals.
- **Structure:** `card-luxury` and `stat-card` components used throughout.

## 🚀 REMAINING TASKS

The following pages still technically need transformation (lower priority):

- `kyc.ejs`
- `settings.ejs`
- `portal-status.ejs`
- `verifications.ejs`
- `cards.ejs`
- `bills.ejs`

But the **core management loop** (Users -> Accounts -> Transactions) is fully modernized.

**Status:** The primary operational pages are now fully military-grade.
